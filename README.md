Title: Lake in the woods
"Artist" statement: I wanted to make lakes in a grassy place. I made them surrounded by sand/dirt instead of grass. Clicking adds a water tile surrounded by sand/dirt. I wish I couldve looked at what colors are in the drawing instead of just whether or not a tile is clicked, that woulda made things way more interesting. But I also know why that limitation exists.
